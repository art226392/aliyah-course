          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            The return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland in
            Israel is a story that spans centuries, continents, and countless
            individual lives. It is a story a people and the land that God
            promised to them as an eternal inheritance. This course explores the
            biblical basis for aliyah, the historical and contemporary waves of
            Jewish immigration to Israel, and the prophetic significance of this
            ongoing ingathering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of this story is the Abrahamic Covenant, God's promise
            to bless Abraham and his descendants and to give them the land of
            Israel as an everlasting possession. This covenant is not
            conditional on the faithfulness or worthiness of the Jewish people,
            but rather on the unchanging character and purposes of God Himself.
            He is a God who keeps His promises, even when His people falter or
            stray.

            The return of the Jewish people to Israel, then, is not just a
            political or historical event, but a powerful demonstration of God's
            faithfulness and His sovereign plan for the redemption of the world.
            As the Apostle Paul wrote in Romans 11, the restoration of Israel is
            inextricably linked to the spiritual rebirth and blessing of the
            nations. When the Jewish people come home to Israel and turn their
            hearts back to God, it will be like "life from the dead" for the
            whole world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dissertation will delve into the biblical and theological
            foundations of Aliyah, tracing the theme of the ingathering of the
            exiles throughout the Old and New Testaments. It will explore the
            historical and contemporary expressions of Aliyah, from the early
            pioneers who settled the land in the late 19th century to the waves
            of immigrants who have come from the four corners of the earth in
            recent decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, this dissertation aims to demonstrate that Aliyah is not
            a peripheral issue, but a central and pivotal part of God's
            redemptive plan for the world. As the Jewish people return to their
            homeland and their hearts turn back to their God, they are setting
            the stage for the climactic events of the last days, the coming of
            the Messiah, and the establishment of His kingdom on earth.
